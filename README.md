# Restful API

### A simple web-app that shows the user a person's name and their role.

The main purpose of making this app was to continue to get to know PHP better, which a particular focus on restful routing. I feel I am starting to get a better understanding of PHP and for restful routing. The front end is non-existent, this is something I'd like to improve in the future.
